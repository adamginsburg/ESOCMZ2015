Total molecular mass?  $4\times10^7$ M$_\odot$ out to $r<200$ pc?

 Slightly less than 5\% of the total molecular gas reservoir of $\sim8.4\times10^8$ \msun in the Galaxy is concentrated in the center of the Galaxy, in a region with a diameter of $\sim$ 600 parsecs \citep{Dahmen98,Nakanishi06}. The total mass of molecular gas in the CMZ is believed to be 3$^{+2}_{-1}\times10^7$ \msun \citep{Dahmen98}, with 10\% of this gas concentrated in one giant molecular cloud complex, Sgr B2 \citep{Gordon93}, located $\sim$ 100 parsecs in projection to the east of the dynamical center of the Galaxy.
