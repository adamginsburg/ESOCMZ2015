\section{Molecular gas around a black hole}
How is molecular gas affected by the presence of Sgr A*?  Do we see its effects anywhere beyond the circumnuclear disk?  (yes) SiO has been suggested to be correlated with the Fe 6.4 KeV line in the central 200 pc \citep{JMP00}, with the G0.11-0.11 cloud \citep{Handa} being a notable example of very high SiO abundances correlating with the time-variable X-ray emission \citep{Ponti10}.
