Large surveys of the CMZ: More needed?  How should we prioritize?
\begin{enumerate}
\item LASMA band 7 APEX survey?
\item JCMT-HARPS CO 3-2 survey? 
\item Multi-J 13CO surveys?
\end{enumerate}

Followup to APEX 1.4mm survey?  Bigger, deeper, complementary transitions?

Followup to SMACMZ survey?  More area?  Higher frequency? Multiple frequencies?  ALMA, SMA? 

Low frequencies: VLA large survey?  Extension of \citet{Law2008b} continuum survey?
\begin{enumerate}
\item (deep) S band, to include CH and recombination lines?  
\item X band, to include HC3N 1-0?
\end{enumerate}
