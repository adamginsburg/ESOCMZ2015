\section{Preparing for Cycle 4}

What line surveys (single dish and other) exist?

Cover a large area with a single band (3?) or a targeted cloud sample at multiple bands for, e.g., excitation?


ALMA configuration options:

\begin{itemize}
    \item No special modes (OTF)
    \item Vanilla setup: band 3, 4, 5, or 6 (or 7)
    \item At least 2 GHz continuum?  Or just spectral line?
\end{itemize}
