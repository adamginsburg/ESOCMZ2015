\section{The "Dense" ISM}
Discussions on what would normally be considered high-density gas ($n\sim10^4$ cm$^{-3}$) but in the CMZ is "typical".

What are the true gas densities and what is the density distribution?  Which clouds are bound?  Are they supported by turbulence, magnetic fields, thermal pressure, shear, or are they freely collapsing?

What are the magnetic fields and temperatures of these clouds?

What is the geometry of the molecular gas in the CMZ - is there really a ring?  Are the clouds on elliptical orbits?  Which orbits?

Do cosmic rays, turbulence, x-rays, photons at other wavelengths, or other mechanisms heat the cloud interiors?  Exteriors?

What do we still need to understand from the kinematics?  Are positions every uniquely associated with a given kinematic signature?  How can we describe the turbulence?

What explains the "cloud collision" kinematics often seen toward CMZ clouds \citep{Tanaka2015a,Tanaka2014a,Oka2012a}?
