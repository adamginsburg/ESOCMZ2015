\section{Comparison to other Galaxies}
What are the most similar galactic centers to our own?
What can we learn from comparing these galaxies to ours?

How does our galactic center compare with other galaxies?  Its pressure and sensitivity are similar to high-z star-forming galaxies \citep{Kruijssen2013a}.

    \item M83: similar mass galaxy, more active CMZ, face on
\end{enumerate}
