8 GHz now, 16 GHz future, but extra 8 GHz probably only good for continuum

Data to become public when they are reduced.

How can we identify star forming cores?  Original idea: hot core tracers + outflows.  Does that work? CH$_3$OH masers, but incomplete/maybe just shock tracers?

Evolutionary sequence in massive cores seen in dust ridge clouds.  Steve: free-fall times come from single-dish, large scale.  Diederik: position along ridge dominates spread in density.

Lines mapped: H$_2$CO, C$^{18}$O, CH$_3$OH, $^{13}$CO, SiO.

Sgr B2: Free-free is still dominant at 1mm
