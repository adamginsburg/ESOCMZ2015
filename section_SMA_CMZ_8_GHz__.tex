8 GHz now, 16 GHz future, but extra 8 GHz probably only good for continuum

Data to become public when they are reduced.

How can we identify star forming cores?  Original idea: hot core tracers + outflows.  Does that work? CH$_3$OH masers, but incomplete/maybe just shock tracers?

Evolutionary sequence in massive cores seen in dust ridge clouds.  Steve: free-fall times come from single-dish, large scale.  Diederik: position along ridge dominates spread in density. (Comment by Diederik: I have now checked this quantitatively and it turns out that the position is indeed somewhat more important, but not by much -- from Table 2 in \citet{Kruijssen2015a}, the time-scale spread is from $0.30~\Myr$ post-pericentre to 0.74 post-pericentre (a factor of 2.5), whereas the density spread is factor of 4 => factor of 2 in free-fall time.)

Lines mapped: H$_2$CO, C$^{18}$O, CH$_3$OH, $^{13}$CO, SiO.

Sgr B2: Free-free is still dominant at 1mm

Lots of interesting & impressive detections.  PDFs - do they mean anything?
