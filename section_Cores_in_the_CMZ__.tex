\section{Cores in the CMZ}
Protostellar cores are, by definition, the precursors to stars.  What do they look like in the CMZ?  Are there good chemical tracers for cores in the CMZ?  Are dust-based masses accurate?  

Why don't we observe cores in The Brick?  Are they absent, or invisible?  Do we see cores in other clouds?  How do cores in the CMZ compare with cores in the Galactic plane?
