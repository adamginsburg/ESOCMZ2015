\section{Comparison to the Galactic Disk}
How does star formation differ in our Galactic center from the rest of the Galaxy? 

\citet{Longmore2013b}: Lower SFR/dense gas

How do the isotope ratios in the center of the Milky Way compare to the disk? $^{13}$C/$^{12}$C appears lower, at least, \citep[e.g.,][]{Riq10}, as do more recent estimates of the $^{15}$N/$^{14}$N ratio \citep{AZ11}.
