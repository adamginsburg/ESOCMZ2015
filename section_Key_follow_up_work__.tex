\section{Key follow-up work}
\begin{itemize}
\item Further proper motion studies.  Interested: Everyone.
\item Large spatial scale ($b\pm1$\deg) CO mapping to test Diederik's latest theory
\item SEPIA line surveys - what is useful in Band 5?
\item keep an eye on the CO J=3-2 mapping projects (ongoing) - they may lead to  followup with LASMA higher-J high-density tracers?  (characterize density, temperature more accurately)
\end{itemize}
