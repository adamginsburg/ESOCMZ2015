\section{Hi-Gal Compact Sources}

Single-band extraction with subsequent band-merging

Inner region: 27\% "protostellar" and 73\% "prestellar" sources in $|\ell|<5$.
Large dispersion in latitude for both populations.

Most higal "cores" are clouds in the CMZ

Qizhou: Correlation with 24\um sources?  Yes, included.  Do all 24 \um sources have 70 \um counterparts?  Yes.

Dust temperature: CMZ vs Galactic disk -  essentially the same in both.  16 vs 13 K for proto/pre-stellar.  L/M is also nearly the same in and out of the CMZ... slightly less difference in the CMZ than outside.
